# Hurricane Sonification

Dependencies:

SuperCollider:

https://supercollider.github.io/

Simply download SuperCollider and open the hurricane noise file in SC. Then follow the comments that instruct you to boot the server, and then start the program. You can then run the python file to read through the CSV file with hurricane wind speed and pressure data and send it to SuperCollider over OSC.
